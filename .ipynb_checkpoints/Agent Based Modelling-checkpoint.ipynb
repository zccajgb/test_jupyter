    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Agent based modelling is a simple way of building up complex models. It is quite a logical way to look at a system. \n",
    "For example, if we were modelling the way water flows, we would consider each water molecule individually, and define some rules about how it moves, and how it interacts with other water particles. \n",
    "\n",
    "This can be extended to chemical and biological systems quite easily. For example for a simple chemical reaction, we can consider individual molecules, and define rules for how they move around, then if they collide with another particle, we can set rules for if they react or not. \n",
    "\n",

    "### Object Oriented Programming\n",
    "We are going to exploit objected-oriented (OO) programming to make this easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- OO is based around objects, which are implementations of classes.\n",
    "- Classes are a type of data structure that contains properties and methods\n",
    "    - Properties are simply data values, the class human may have properties such as height, weight, etc.\n",
    "    - Methods are things that do something. They are similar to functions or procedures, but apply to objects\n",
    "        - methods can either return a value or return nothing\n",
    "        - methods can have \"side effects\", i.e. they can cause other things to happen\n",
    "- Here is a simple example of a class.\n"

    "- have the movement be more realistic:\n",
    "    - rather than moving on a 1d grid, use physically accurate representations of movement, e.g. brownian motion\n",
    "    - look at the way we generate random numbers, does this reflect physics?\n",
    "- make the interaction criteria cleverer:\n",
    "    - instead of assuming two agents in the same position will interact, have two agents in a certain distance able to interact\n",
    "    - make a reaction dependent on a probability (i.e. to make a reaction 50% likely, generate a random number thats either 1 or zero)\n",
    "        - we can then make this probability physically realistic (see Metropolis algorithm)\n",
    "- have two different agents types, one representing the nanoparticle, one representing the surface\n",
    "    - initially have the surface stationary, and have the nanoparticle move\n",
    "- increase the complexity of the agents, to add in ligands and receptors\n",
    "    - now the nanoparticle doesnt bind to the surface, but the ligand binds with the receptors\n",
    "    - maybe keep the surface/nanoparticle stationary, but allow receptors to move (remembering theyre bound to the surface by their tether so have restricted movement)\n",
    "    - maybe then allow the nanoparticle to move, so the ligands can move within their tether length\n",
    "- create more complex models with different ligands and different receptors\n",
